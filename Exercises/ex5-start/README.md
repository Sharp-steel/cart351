EXERCISE 5

For this exercise I wanted to use an elemental theme, taking the four main elements: Fire, Water, Air and Earth to visually display the corresponding data entries.

QUERY 3:

The third query takes all entries in the collection that have an after_mood value that is positive and arranges them into individual data points. These points are then scattered with different colours to represent the level of positivity from yellow being the lowest to bright red being the highest.

I used the Fire element and created a Flare shape with the various data points with bright colours to represent positive energy and excitement. Fire can also represent a burning desire, which could be an indicator of productivity.

QUERY 4:

The fourth query does a similar job, however it takes all events and sorts them by event name. Each coloured point represents a different event and is then divided into clouds which categorize the various events.

I used clouds to represent the Air since it represents organization. It is also a fitting metaphor that could represent the functionality of a cloud server which also stores data in an organized fashion.

QUERY 5:

The fifth query takes data only that happens on a Monday or a Tuesday, and sorts them separately by using the event_affect_strength parameter, which uses a 1-9 scale. Each dot represents a value between 1-9, using rounded down numbers to colour a blade of grass.

I used grass to represent the Earth element. I wanted to showcase the difference in energy levels between a Monday and a Tuesday effectively, with brown grass representing a dull Monday and green grass representing a more hopeful Tuesday.

QUERY 6:

The sixth query selects all of the data that falls into the negative category of start_mood and after_mood combined, and sorts it by the category of weather. Each form of weather is represented by a different colour.

I used rain to represent the element of Water, since it was very fitting with the weather data that I was pulling. It also showcased a more depressing side of the data the worse the weather was. If it was stormy, the darker the colour was and the more sunny it was the brighter the colour became.
