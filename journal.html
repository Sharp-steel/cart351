                <h4>Week 2</h4>
                <article>
                    My hope for this semester is to maintain and add to my coding repetoire. Last class 
                    we learned about Python and so far it feels way more streamlined than JavaScript. I 
                    already understand the syntax better than I did with JavaScript and for me I feel a 
                    little bit more at ease using Python than JavaScript. I would usually feel very
                    overwhelmed when using JavaScript and at times it would be very challenging to remember how to
                    perform something specific when I had no real direction. I hope to continue learning more
                    about the intricacies of coding and that I am able to add another useful asset to my skillset.

                <article>
                    This course has gotten off to a pretty good start. The first exercise was fairly straight forward
                    for me and I did very well on it. I only had slight difficulty with the last couple of instructions
                    but managed to figure it out. Python definitely has felt more intuitive for me so far. For me it is
                    much easier to understand the logic of how the code works as opposed to JavaScript. I still have some
                    slight difficulties with for loops and getting the syntax correctly, but this problem has carried over
                    from JavaScript so I am not so worried about it being an issue within Python. Also kind of stressed about
                    Project 1, hope it isn't too stressful.

                <article>
                    Today we introduced to Flask. We set up the Flask environment and learned about routing using Python to 
                    connect to our HTML pages through the Jinja templates. I liked the simplicity of routing different HTML 
                    pages and it feels super intiuitive. I'm personally a much bigger fan of how organized the code is within
                    Jinja templates and how everything feels more interconnected instead of having to copy paste the same
                    header and footer styling across HTML documents over and over again. Either way, Project 1 is due and it
                    is about the Air Quality Index API. Time to get working.

                <article>
                    STM strike moment. I finished Project 1, which involved pulling data from the Air Quality Index API and
                    displaying it through creative visuals within the terminal. I decided to create it based on Higher or
                    Lower, the web game that compares two different subjects and how many Google searches it has, except
                    I measured the air quality of specific cities instead. It was very fun surprisingly, especially playing
                    around with the Rich library was quite enjoyable.

                <article>
                    How is it already the second half of the semester? Either way, we resumed work with Flask this week,
                    where we continued to learn about what we had initially learned in Week 4. I applied what was taught
                    through Exercise 2, which involved setting up a Flask application that used Jinja templates, GET
                    requests, and user input. This took a bit of time for me to eventually finish but I eventually did
                    it even though it wasn't perfect.

                <article>
                    Oh god not JavaScript. Please no. We learned this week about sessions and GET/POST. From my understanding, sessions are essentially a way
                    in which user data is stored across different pages through requests, and GET/POST is a form of request
                    that proved to be crucial for future projects of mine. I also have no idea what to do for my Project 2,
                    so I need to come up with an idea pretty quickly.

                <article>
                    More STM strike shenanigans. More JavaScript. Not a fantastic combo. We were introduced to storing information
                    through JSON files based on user input. This would make for a really useful tool to utilize within my second
                    project, however at this time I was still struggling to find a concept for it. Contrary to this I was able to
                    finish Exercise 3 without any real issues. I encorporated a cookie clicker like game, where the user's would
                    click on a square box and their amount of clicks would be stored and returned client-side. This was a very
                    simple yet effective method of utilizing POST and FETCH.

                <h4>Week 9</h4>
                <article>
                    I finished my second Project, where I prioritized functionality over design. Admittedly, this wasn't the best
                    approach I had towards a project, since I only worked on it over a singular weekend before the deadline, however,
                    I was able to come up with a simple This or That interface which acted almost like a survey. The results would
                    be stored through the JSON file, which I had some difficulty with, but found a fix in the end. This week in class
                    was a MongoDB 101. This seemed like a more streamlined method of storing data, and it was stored on a cloud
                    instead of being stored in a JSON file. This would make for a more secure method of storing data online without
                    it being easily compromised.

                <article>
                    This week we had a look at other people's 2nd project for Exercise 4. I was very nervous to show mine
                    since it felt very rushed. However, it was very useful to have a look at other people's ideas and gain 
                    inspiration from their visual designs and back-end functionality. We also briefly covered websockets 
                    and it was really cool to understand how they worked.

                <article>
                    Work period today. I worked on Exercise 5. I'm almost at the end of the road. I enjoyed the ideation phase for
                    this project. MongoDB is not as bad as I thought it would be. I still don't like that we are encorporating
                    JavaScript in this class, but it is what it is.

                <article>
                    Another work period today. I worked on finishing Project 3. This project was an interactive world map, where a user
                    is prompted to describe a country on the map using a singular sentence. This would then be stored through MongoDB
                    and returned for everyone to see. Once again the ideation phase was fun, the HTML, CSS and Flask was fun, 
                    discovering GeoJSON was fun. The JavaScript though, makes me want to crash out. I don't want to rant about JavaScript
                    any further at this point but when things don't work even though the logic is there, it makes me really upset.
                    Just glad to have reached the end at this point, and looking back I learned a lot of valuable skills through
                    this course.
