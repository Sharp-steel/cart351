                        My hope for this semester is to maintain and add to my coding repetoire. Last class 
                        we learned about Python and so far it feels way more streamlined than JavaScript. I 
                        already understand the syntax better than I did with JavaScript and for me I feel a 
                        little bit more at ease using Python than JavaScript. I would usually feel very
                        overwhelmed when using JavaScript and at times it would be very challenging to remember how to
                        perform something specific when I had no real direction. I hope to continue learning more
                        about the intricacies of coding and that I am able to add another useful asset to my skillset.

                        This course has gotten off to a pretty good start. The first exercise was fairly straight forward
                        for me and I did very well on it. I only had slight difficulty with the last couple of instructions
                        but managed to figure it out. Python definitely has felt more intuitive for me so far. For me it is
                        much easier to understand the logic of how the code works as opposed to JavaScript. I still have some
                        slight difficulties with for loops and getting the syntax correctly, but this problem has carried over
                        from JavaScript so I am not so worried about it being an issue within Python. Also kind of stressed about
                        Project 1, hope it isn't too stressful.
