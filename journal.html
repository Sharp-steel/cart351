                        My hope for this semester is to maintain and add to my coding repetoire. Last class 
                        we learned about Python and so far it feels way more streamlined than JavaScript. I 
                        already understand the syntax better than I did with JavaScript and for me I feel a 
                        little bit more at ease using Python than JavaScript. I would usually feel very
                        overwhelmed when using JavaScript and at times it would be very challenging to remember how to
                        perform something specific when I had no real direction. I hope to continue learning more
                        about the intricacies of coding and that I am able to add another useful asset to my skillset.
